# Game-in-10-hours
We have 10 hours to create a game with the thematic of Random...

## How it works
We are going to use [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to program this game. These two games were made using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/). 

## What Lukitronix did:

```python
import 42
print("game in progress")
```
## What ProRobotXXL did:

```python
import 42
print("game in progress")
```
